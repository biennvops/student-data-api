# Student data API

A free and open source Python implementation of a specific university app's API.

## Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Copy the environment template and configure your secrets:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit `.env` file with your own API keys and secrets.

4. Write your own clients.

And it ends here. Good luck figuring out the API keys :)
